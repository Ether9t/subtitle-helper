1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,380
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,040
So if you're like me, then you've probably been in that situation where it's the end

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,180
of the day or it's the morning and you're thinking like, okay, I'm going to make a solid

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,660
plan for myself.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,280
Today, I'm going to be disciplined.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,780
I'm going to come home from work and I'm going to get all these errands done and I'm going

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,520
to treat myself really well. I'm going to make a nice, healthy, proper meal.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm going to go to the gym afterwards. I'm going to exercise and then maybe when I come

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,480
home, I'll like start reading a book or something. I'll do something a little different.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,980
Something that makes me feel like I'm going to advance my life in a new, positive direction.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,820
This is our real life volition and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,380
decisions.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,260
But this doesn't always work out that way.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,780
Sometimes you get to the end of the day and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,760
At all.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,940
A lot of those errands are still incomplete or half-started.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,020
We didn't end up going to the gym and instead of making a proper meal, we've ordered some

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,560
definitely not healthy takeout food.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,040
And instead of reading that book, maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,060
and we've not advanced our life in a positive, meaningful direction in any way at all.

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,940
What is happening here?

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,780
Why would we ignore the voice of volition that's telling us to do all of these beneficial

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,940
positive things?

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,740
Well, it could be a lot of things, honestly.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,630
And definitely having a mental health diagnosis is going to amplify this problem a lot

26
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,020
more.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,260
But even for the average person, this happens pretty often.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,120
I mean, it certainly happens to me.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,810
So what I wanted to share with you today is a framework for understanding why this problem

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,940
happens and what we can actually do about it.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,720
This is a real problem that actually comes up in my work as a therapist kind of often.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:14,110
And I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated so clearly and given such a unique role within

33
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,360
the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has.

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,090
So okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition and go through

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,340
with our good intentions.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,360
And it has to do with something called psychological friction.

37
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,300
So in this context, friction is any force either internal or external, which opposes a behavioral

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,820
change.

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,680
So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,740
If I am standing on an ice rink and I move my body weight around a little bit, I'm going

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,520
to start sliding around on the ice.

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,980
There's not a lot of friction between me and the surface that's under me.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,680
When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete, when I shift myself around,

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,940
I don't move, right?

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,840
There is a lot more friction between me and the ground.

46
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,380
And psychologically, this principle is basically the same thing.

47
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,740
If you imagine you're trying to do something, it's going to be much harder if there is

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,420
more friction between you and the process and it's going to be much easier if there is

49
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,140
less friction.

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
When friction is introduced and we'll talk about what kinds of friction are very common,

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,440
the process tends to slow down.

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,900
We tend to have a harder time actually completing the thing we're trying to do and it's much more

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,650
likely that we're going to give up.

54
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,520
When there is less friction or we find a way to reduce the friction that's there, the

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,100
process can start to speed up again and we'll find more motivation to actually keep working

56
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,600
on it.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,820
Really we can kind of think of this how habits work, right?

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,840
When you're trying to do something new, it can be hard to stay motivated and be consistent

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,780
and be very disciplined in it.

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,660
We have to be very rigorous and consistent with things before they start to get easier

61
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,520
and we have to do less work to get ourselves in the mindset to do it.

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,780
Like if we're trying to start an exercise, regiment or something, so there's a lot of

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,500
friction between us and this new behavioral change.

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,480
Things start to get easier when we learn more about that process and we start developing

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,540
sort of like the mental tricks to get ourselves into that kind of mode where we want to do

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:30,680
it.

67
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,650
We don't have to convince ourselves anymore and our stamina to do the thing that's

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,260
difficult starts to go up and there's a lot less friction here.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,010
We start to develop that habit when the process becomes streamlined and simplified and we

70
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,440
have to do less of the psychological work to get ourselves moving on it.

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,490
So basically the things that we tend to do the most and the patterns of behavior that

72
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,840
we tend to repeat are those where the amount of friction between us and the process is

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,700
very minimal.

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,280
So this is part of why when we tell ourselves we're going to do all of these nice things,

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,200
a lot of friction tends to get introduced in that process because thinking about doing

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,900
all of those things isn't really that hard but when it comes down to it, it takes an extra

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,400
layer of scheduling and timing and trying to like balance your energy throughout the day,

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,060
you better make sure that you slept enough, ate well enough to that you're hydrated,

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,260
that you actually have the motivation at the time you're trying to do that thing to actually

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,540
start it.

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,880
Honestly, at the end of a long day we're not typically still in the high motivation

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,980
state that we were at the beginning of the day when volition was telling us how awesome

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,460
we're going to be sometime later.

84
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:59,740
We are not always interested or capable sometimes of fighting against all of the friction that

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,880
has found us along the way.

86
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,580
So we choose things that are less difficult, right?

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,460
The kinds of habits that we've already formed that we know work that don't require a

88
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,780
lot of mental fortitude to carry out.

89
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,900
Volition asks us to do things which are good for us but that they are difficult to accomplish.

90
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,020
And so it's often the voices of half-light or electrochemistry that give us other options

91
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,280
and don't ask us to fight against a bunch of friction.

92
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,040
They just want us to chase whatever impulse makes sense in the moment.

93
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,260
You should tell people to f*** off more often.

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,300
I should.

95
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,100
I should do that.

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,860
Then you shouldn't.

97
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,680
You're an officer of the law.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,640
Maybe I shouldn't.

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,550
So this has been really fascinating to see portrayed in disco-alecium because in my

100
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,120
playthrough I've been kind of role-playing and demonstrating this whole problem, right?

101
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,520
And so sometimes volition will chime in with a thought and I just ignore it.

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,530
And I go do something that for a lot of people looks like it's not really within my character's

103
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,840
best interest and they're right.

104
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,460
But that's how people are.

105
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,540
We are kind of walking contradictions.

106
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,500
We just don't always act in our own best interests.

107
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,380
Like I said, even though the thought to do something good is available to us, that doesn't

108
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,140
mean we're actually going to do it.

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,730
In fact, we're very keenly aware a lot of the times that we are doing something that's

110
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,880
not in our best interest.

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,570
And we're pulling the ice cream out of the fridge and telling ourselves along the way

112
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,860
I really shouldn't.

113
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,020
But I'm gonna anyway.

114
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,630
So this is a real problem, right?

115
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,380
And the game is so good at demonstrating this.

116
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,480
So what do you do about this, right?

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,180
I like the word friction because it gives us a very easy framework to understand.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,820
And so when I'm working with someone who is struggling with motivation or a lot of times

119
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,140
we're sort of questioning, like, I'm very passionate about this thing, but I don't find

120
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,440
myself doing it a lot.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,640
Like I don't know what's wrong with me.

122
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,100
Maybe I've lost interest in it.

123
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,480
That's where we may start to ask the question, okay, well, what kind of friction is in this

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,680
process for you and how might we start to work to reduce it?

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,900
And the best place to start is actually trying to understand whether this friction is even

126
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,820
real or not because that's the thing.

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,140
There is real psychological friction and perceived psychological friction.

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,380
Now, that is not to say that friction by itself is a bad thing.

129
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,640
In fact, there are some cases where introducing friction to some sort of behavioral process

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,540
is actually a good thing.

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,980
Think about an addiction, for example, right, which is a big part of dysgolism where the

132
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:02,740
habit to seek and use a substance has become very normalized for us and we're always looking

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,900
to have the least amount of friction between us and continuing that substance use.

134
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,080
And so actually when you're trying to work on breaking a habit or lower the chances

135
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,140
that an addiction develops, you actually want to introduce friction to the process.

136
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,300
Essentially, making things harder is going to slow down and make completely interrupt

137
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,520
the process that we are trying to change.

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,220
This is why when people are trying to quit a substance, they typically go to a detox center

139
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,000
and then they go into full rehabilitation.

140
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,200
And that's to completely separate themselves from the environment and all of the social

141
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,820
and psychological issues which made repeating that pattern of behavior very easy.

142
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,890
We want to introduce a ton of friction to this person's life temporarily so that we can

143
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,330
learn to develop better strategies to cope with the issues that resulted in some sort of

144
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,700
addiction.

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,720
So this was all pretty well demonstrated in my own playthrough in which we spent a lot

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,150
of time trying to find a way to buy a pack of cigarettes and I was explaining how when

147
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,200
we have a chemical dependence on something, we are often going to prioritize that over

148
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,820
most other things, higher order things like solving a crime or strengthening our relationships.

149
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,640
Also the thought pattern may have been something like, okay, well, our character wants to smoke.

150
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,240
How do I do that?

151
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,880
What's the simplest path here?

152
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,040
I want to find the way with the least amount of friction like I need this now.

153
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,020
So we go into Frita and Frita girl is there.

154
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,820
And she tells us that we don't have the money for cigarettes.

155
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
There's a way that we can get the money for cigarettes.

156
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,280
What we can do is we can collect tear and tear is trash.

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,150
And so what we can do is try to find a bag so that we can pick up all the tear and revisher

158
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,090
and we'll spend as much time as we need to collecting this so that we can go and buy

159
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,740
the cigarettes.

160
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,740
And that sounds like kind of a difficult drawn out process.

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,170
And it was, however, there was less friction in doing that than there would be if I tried

162
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,680
to solve this murder without the stimulant that my body is craving.

163
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,960
I may have been telling myself, look, this whole detective thing is just way too hard without

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,420
a buzz.

165
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,200
There's too much friction.

166
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,300
I can't talk to people.

167
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,280
I can't think straight.

168
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm going to do this other thing that's still difficult, but maybe it will help reduce

169
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,560
the amount of friction in this other bigger, more difficult task.

170
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,480
And then we'll go do it.

171
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,240
And that is an example of totally made up perceived fake friction.

172
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,620
Like smoking cigarettes doesn't actually make us a better detective.

173
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,460
Like, it gives us maybe a false sense of like plus one to our intellect.

174
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,380
But we may have convinced ourselves as many people who are struggling with substances

175
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,320
do that we are inadequate or unable to perform a certain task without this thing.

176
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,440
And so like we look at that and say, no, there's too much friction.

177
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
I can't do that.

178
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,620
It's too hard.

179
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,160
Having this substance will make it easier.

180
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,440
When really what we have done is just choose something that's equally hard and we're reinforcing

181
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
a bad pattern of behavior.

182
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,460
And one that's pretty bad for us.

183
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,240
So that was a demonstration of the perceived kind of friction, right?

184
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,600
Then this happened again, nearing the end of our first day in Revishall, in which my

185
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,260
character had also been searching for ways to drink alcohol.

186
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,760
And so we come to the end of the day and we hadn't really found any opportunities to do

187
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,120
that besides like licking some alcohol off of a table.

188
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,080
But so we're standing there at the end of the day and we're talking to Gart who is the

189
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,420
manager of the whirling and rags and we're asking him like, can I buy a drink?

190
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,220
Look I've had a long day, okay?

191
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,480
I spent most of it looking for cigarettes and then I did a little bit of detective work

192
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,220
and it has tired me out, okay?

193
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,720
Now I need the other substance that I'm dependent on to sleep all of this off.

194
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,720
And that's when Gart tells us like, dude, I'm not the bartender, okay?

195
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
I don't actually serve drinks here.

196
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,880
Find another way to get drunk.

197
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,720
You know what?

198
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,260
The impact of rejection is stronger than the impulse to drink from my guy right now as

199
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,000
a sorry cop.

200
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:47,280
I abandoned, I'm going to abandon the desire to drink because I am too ashamed to ask

201
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,640
further.

202
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,720
He effectively made it more difficult for us to do this and in my mind and in simulating

203
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,590
the character's perspective, like we decided that this was just too much work, right?

204
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,580
Like we're already tired enough.

205
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,440
Who knows how much more time and effort and money this was going to take to get some

206
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,500
alcohol, right?

207
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,220
And so we gave up.

208
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,780
There was too much friction introduced to the process that it would involve talking

209
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,180
to people, it would have involved budgeting, it would have involved embarrassing ourselves

210
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,140
even more.

211
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,700
And so with a lot of friction introduced to the process, this slowed down and has the

212
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,980
potential to completely interrupt the problem behavior.

213
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:39,620
So I just find this whole thing fascinating that the voice of Elisha represents what is

214
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:47,160
in real life just our good intentions to make healthy balance decisions for ourselves.

215
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,980
And yet typically the things that it wants us to do require a lot of effort, a lot of

216
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,860
deep behavioral changes and there are often a lot of barriers in between us and doing

217
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:06,580
them. And here you have like other voices which have not so great intentions for us in

218
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,140
competition with volition and there's way less friction involved in those.

219
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,280
And so we chase those impulses even though we know we shouldn't.

220
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,960
That is just real life.

221
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,580
And I love Disco Elysium for this.

222
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,520
It's been one of my favorite parts of the game so far.

223
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,260
So what can you take away from this?

224
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,880
Consider a change that you've been trying to make recently or a habit that you're trying

225
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,540
to break and ask yourself, like what is the friction involved in this process, right?

226
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,020
Like what is making it hard for me to make this good change?

227
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
And is that a real source of friction or is it one that I'm kind of like perceiving?

228
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,900
Because at the end of the day we choose to ignore a volition even though we know it's

229
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,760
there and that it actually wants something better for us.

230
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,900
I genuinely think that making a change is not always about working harder at something.

231
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,230
In fact, a lot of times I think it's about making the process easier, right?

232
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,800
Simpler, streamlined, with the least amount of friction.

233
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,920
And you may find that over time, just like any other habit, the more you train yourself

234
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,970
to detect and resolve the sources of friction in your life, you actually find it a little

235
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,580
easier to listen to volition when it talks to you.

236
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,060
So that is why we ignore a volition in real life.

237
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,800
I am very curious to hear what all of you think about this.

238
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,320
And if there's anything that you can think of that is a source of friction in your life

239
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,680
that you may not even even really know is there.

240
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,980
So far, disco-aliceum has been amazing at like bringing together real mental health with

241
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,800
practical game mechanics.

242
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,410
And I find that really fun to talk about.

243
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,780
So I'm also curious if there's other games and other systems in them that you think

244
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,300
would be worthy of this kind of analysis as well.

245
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,140
Who knows?

246
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,660
Maybe this could be like a series or something where we talk about like the crossover

247
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,700
between game design and mental health and how mechanics can represent real cognitive structures

248
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,300
that we use and deal with every day.

249
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,180
So thank you for watching my video.

250
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,340
I hope you enjoyed it.

251
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,840
Yeah, let me know if you'd like to hear more of this kind of discussion with other game

252
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,320
mechanics.

253
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,840
And if you want to see more of where these ideas are kind of taking shape and the discussions

254
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,940
we're having about them, we're currently uploading a full Let's Play of disco-aliceum

255
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,780
with lots of like psychological analysis intermixed in that.

256
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,680
So subscribe if you want to catch those as they release or other standalone analyses

257
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,080
like this one.

258
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,220
Right now these two are the friction between me and finishing this video.

259
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,700
It's okay, I love them.

260
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,340
So with that said, I will see you guys next time.

261
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm going to go try to make some of my own good decisions right now.
