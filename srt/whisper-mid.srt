1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,120
So if you're like me, then you've probably been in that situation where it's the end

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,880
of the day or it's the morning and you're thinking like, okay, I'm going to make a solid

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,600
plan for myself.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
Today I'm going to be disciplined.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm going to come home from work and I'm going to get all these errands done and I'm going

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,240
to treat myself really well.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm going to make a nice healthy proper meal.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,480
I'm going to go to the gym afterwards.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm going to exercise and then maybe when I come home, I'll like start reading a book

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
or something.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,240
You know, I'll do something a little different, something that makes me feel like I'm going

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,120
to advance my life in a new positive direction.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,840
This is our real life volition and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,240
decisions.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,800
This doesn't always work out that way.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,440
Sometimes you get to the end of the day and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
at all.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,920
A lot of those errands are still incomplete or like half started.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,040
We didn't end up going to the gym and instead of making a proper meal, we've ordered some

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,240
definitely not healthy takeout food.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,160
And instead of reading that book, maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,160
and we've not advanced our life in a positive, meaningful direction in any way at all.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,720
What is happening here?

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,160
Why would we ignore the voice of volition that's telling us to do all of these beneficial,

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
positive things?

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,200
Well, it could be a lot of things, honestly, and definitely having like a mental health

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
diagnosis is going to amplify this problem a lot more.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,440
But even for the average person, this happens like pretty often.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,000
I mean, it certainly happens to me.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,880
So what I wanted to share with you today is a framework for understanding why this problem

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,640
happens and what we can actually do about it.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,920
This is a real problem that actually comes up in my work as a therapist kind of often.

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,600
And I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated so clearly and given such a unique role within

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,240
the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,760
So, okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition and go

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,960
through with our good intentions.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,360
And it has to do with something called psychological friction.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,800
So in this context, friction is any force, either internal or external, which opposes

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
a behavioral change.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,240
So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,800
If I am standing on an ice rink and I move my body weight around a little bit, I'm going

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,280
to start sliding around on the ice.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,720
There's not a lot of friction between me and the surface that's under me.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,040
When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete, when I shift myself around, I

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,280
don't move, right?

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,600
There is a lot more friction between me and the ground.

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,960
And psychologically, this principle is basically the same thing.

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,120
If you imagine you're trying to do something, it's going to be much harder if there is more

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,360
friction between you and the process.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,880
And it's going to be much easier if there is less friction.

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,480
When friction is introduced, and we'll talk about what kinds of friction are very common,

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,060
the process tends to slow down.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,800
We tend to have a harder time actually completing the thing we're trying to do, and it's much

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,200
more likely that we're going to give up.

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,060
When there is less friction or we find a way to reduce the friction that's there, the process

57
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,420
can start to speed up again and we'll find more motivation to actually keep working on

58
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,420
it.

59
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,320
And really we can kind of think of this how like habits work, right?

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,060
When you're trying to do something new, it can be hard to stay motivated and be consistent

61
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,380
and be very disciplined in it.

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,780
We have to be very rigorous and consistent with things before they start to get easier

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,740
and we have to do less work to get ourselves in the mindset to do it.

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,860
Like if we're trying to start an exercise regimen or something, so there's a lot of

65
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,420
friction between us and this new behavioral change.

66
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,340
Things start to get easier when we learn more about that process and we start developing

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,740
sort of like the mental tricks to get ourselves into that kind of mode where we want to do

68
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,180
it, we don't have to convince ourselves anymore, and our stamina to do the thing that's difficult

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,780
starts to go up and there's a lot less friction here.

70
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,060
We start to develop that habit when the process becomes streamlined and simplified and we

71
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,020
have to do less of the psychological work to get ourselves moving on it.

72
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,740
So basically the things that we tend to do the most and the patterns of behavior that

73
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,860
we tend to repeat are those where the amount of friction between us and the process is

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,220
very minimal.

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,940
So this is part of why when we tell ourselves we're going to do all of these nice things,

76
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,260
a lot of friction tends to get introduced in that process because thinking about doing

77
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,540
all of those things isn't really that hard but when it comes down to it, it takes an

78
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,660
extra layer of scheduling and timing and trying to balance your energy throughout the day.

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,860
You better make sure that you slept enough, ate well enough, that you're hydrated, that

80
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,980
you actually have the motivation at the time you're trying to do that thing to actually

81
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
start it.

82
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,220
And honestly, like at the end of a long day, we're not typically still in the high motivation

83
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,220
state that we were at the beginning of the day when volition was telling us how awesome

84
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,100
we're going to be sometime later.

85
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:00,100
We are not always interested or capable sometimes of fighting against all of the friction that

86
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,300
has found us along the way.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,140
So we choose things that are less difficult, right?

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,820
The kinds of habits that we've already formed that we know work that don't require a lot

89
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,660
of mental fortitude to carry out.

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,580
Volition asks us to do things which are good for us but that they are difficult to accomplish.

91
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,460
And so it's often the voices of half-light or electrochemistry that give us other options

92
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,860
and don't ask us to fight against a bunch of friction.

93
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,900
They just want us to chase whatever impulse makes sense in the moment.

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,500
You should tell people to f*** off more often.

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I should do that.

96
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
No you shouldn't.

97
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,220
You're an officer of the law.

98
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Maybe I shouldn't.

99
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,020
So this has been really fascinating to see portrayed in Disco Elysium because in my playthrough

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,460
I've been kind of role playing and demonstrating this whole problem, right?

101
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,220
And so sometimes Volition will chime in with a thought and I just ignore it and I go do

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,820
something that for a lot of people looks like it's not really within my character's best

103
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,360
interest and they're right.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,580
But that's how people are.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,580
We are kind of walking contradictions.

106
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,500
We just don't always act in our own best interests.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,420
Like I said, even though the thought to do something good is available to us, that doesn't

108
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,660
mean we're actually going to do it.

109
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,740
In fact, we're very keenly aware a lot of the times that we are doing something that's

110
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,600
not in our best interest and we're pulling the ice cream out of the fridge and telling

111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,280
ourselves along the way, I really shouldn't, but I'm gonna anyway.

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,900
So this is a real problem, right?

113
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,860
And the game is so good at demonstrating this.

114
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,780
So what do you do about this, right?

115
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,740
I like the word friction because it gives us a very easy framework to understand.

116
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,540
And so when I'm working with someone who is struggling with like motivation or a lot of

117
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,880
times we're sort of questioning like, I'm very passionate about this thing, but I don't

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,460
find myself doing it a lot.

119
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,020
Like I don't know what's wrong with me.

120
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,460
Maybe I've lost interest in it.

121
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,460
That's where we may start to ask the question, okay, well, what kind of friction is in this

122
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,100
process for you and how might we start to work to reduce it?

123
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,540
And the best place to start is actually trying to understand whether this friction is even

124
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,900
real or not, because that's the thing.

125
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,060
There is real psychological friction and perceived psychological friction.

126
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,980
Now that is not to say that friction by itself is a bad thing.

127
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:45,940
In fact, there are some cases where introducing friction to some sort of behavioral process

128
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,020
is actually a good thing.

129
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,940
Think about an addiction, for example, right?

130
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:59,500
Which is a big part of discoalicium where the habit to seek and use a substance has

131
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,720
become very normalized for us.

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,060
And we're always looking to have the least amount of friction between us and continuing

133
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,420
that substance use.

134
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,420
And so actually when you're trying to work on breaking a habit or lower the chances that

135
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,020
an addiction develops, you actually want to introduce friction to the process.

136
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,620
Essentially making things harder is going to slow down and may completely interrupt

137
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,020
the process that we are trying to change.

138
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,980
This is why when people are trying to quit a substance, they typically go to a detox

139
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,940
center and then they go into full rehabilitation.

140
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,300
And that's to like completely separate themselves from the environment and all of the social

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,220
and psychological issues which made repeating that pattern of behavior very easy.

142
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,740
We want to introduce a ton of friction to this person's life temporarily so that we

143
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,060
can learn to develop better strategies to cope with the issues that resulted in some

144
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,300
sort of addiction.

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,860
So this was all pretty well demonstrated in my own playthrough in which we spent a lot

146
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,100
of time trying to find a way to buy a pack of cigarettes.

147
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,900
And I was explaining how when we have a chemical dependence on something, we are often going

148
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,260
to prioritize that over most other things.

149
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,620
Higher order things like solving a crime or strengthening our relationships.

150
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,500
And so the thought pattern may have been something like, okay, well, our character wants to smoke.

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,700
How do I do that?

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,100
What's the simplest path here?

153
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,940
I want to find the way with the least amount of friction.

154
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,780
Like I need this now.

155
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,220
So we go into Fritte and Fritte girl is there.

156
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,860
And she tells us that we don't have the money for cigarettes.

157
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,220
There's a way that we can get the money for cigarettes.

158
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,300
What we can do is we can collect tear.

159
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,900
And tear is trash.

160
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,580
And so what we can do is try to find a bag so that we can pick up all the tear in Revachal

161
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,060
and we'll spend as much time as we need to collecting this so that we can go and buy

162
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,340
the cigarettes.

163
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,500
And that sounds like kind of a difficult drawn out process.

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,860
And it was.

165
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,980
However, there was less friction in doing that than there would be if I tried to solve

166
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,300
this murder without the stimulant that my body is craving.

167
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,420
I may have been telling myself like, look, this whole detective thing is just way too

168
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
hard without a buzz, right?

169
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
There's too much friction.

170
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,460
I can't talk to people.

171
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,340
I can't think straight, right?

172
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,220
I'm going to do this other thing that's still difficult, but maybe it will help like reduce

173
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,100
the amount of friction in this other bigger, more difficult task.

174
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
And then we'll go do it.

175
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,120
And that is an example of like totally made up perceived fake friction, right?

176
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,100
Like smoking cigarettes doesn't actually make us a better detective.

177
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,380
It gives us a maybe a false sense of like plus one to our intellect.

178
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,540
But we may have convinced ourselves as many people who are struggling with substances

179
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,140
do that we are inadequate or unable to perform a certain task without this thing.

180
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,740
And so like we look at that and say, no, there's too much friction.

181
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,900
I can't do that.

182
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,620
It's too hard.

183
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,500
Having this substance will make it easier when really what we have done is just choose

184
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,580
something that's equally hard and we're reinforcing a bad pattern of behavior and one that's

185
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,420
pretty bad for us.

186
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,560
So that was a demonstration of the perceived kind of friction, right?

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,060
Then this happened again nearing the end of our first day in Revachol in which my character

188
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,900
had also been searching for ways to drink alcohol.

189
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,860
And so we come to the end of the day and we hadn't really found any opportunities to do

190
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,420
that besides like licking some alcohol off of a table.

191
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,100
But so we're standing there at the end of the day and we're talking to Gart who is the

192
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,100
manager of the whirling and rags and we're asking him like, can I buy a drink?

193
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Look I've had a long day, okay?

194
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,540
I spent most of it looking for cigarettes and then I did a little bit of detective work

195
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,940
and it has tired me out, okay?

196
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,200
Now I need the other substance that I'm depended on to sleep all of this off.

197
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,420
And that's when Gart tells us like, dude, I'm not the bartender, okay?

198
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,920
I don't actually serve drinks here.

199
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,380
Find another way to get drunk.

200
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,740
You know what?

201
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,300
The impact of rejection is stronger than the impulse to drink from my guy right now as

202
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,260
a sorry cop.

203
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:47,980
I'm going to abandon the desire to drink because I am too ashamed to ask further.

204
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,860
He effectively made it more difficult for us to do this and in my mind and in simulating

205
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,980
the character's perspective, like we decided that this was just too much work, right?

206
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,380
Like we're already tired enough, who knows how much more time and effort and money this

207
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,660
was going to take to get some alcohol, right?

208
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,140
And so we gave up.

209
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,820
There was too much friction introduced to the process.

210
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,020
It would involve talking to people, it would have involved budgeting, it would have involved

211
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,800
embarrassing ourselves even more.

212
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,740
And so with a lot of friction introduced to the process, this slowed down and has the

213
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,940
potential to completely interrupt the problem behavior.

214
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:39,460
So I just find this whole thing fascinating that the voice of volition represents what

215
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:47,820
in real life just our good intentions to make healthy, balanced decisions for ourselves.

216
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,500
And yet typically the things that it wants us to do require a lot of effort, a lot of

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,100
deep behavioral changes, and there are often a lot of barriers in between us and doing

218
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
them.

219
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,300
And here you have like other voices which have not so great intentions for us in competition

220
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,700
with volition and there's way less friction involved in those.

221
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,580
And so we chase those impulses even though we know we shouldn't.

222
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,740
That is just real life.

223
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,860
And I love Disco Elysium for this.

224
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,100
It's been one of my favorite parts of the game so far.

225
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,060
So what can you take away from this?

226
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,940
Well, consider a change that you've been trying to make recently or a habit that you're trying

227
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,220
to break and ask yourself, like what is the friction involved in this process, right?

228
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,820
What is making it hard for me to make this good change?

229
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,500
And is that a real source of friction or is it one that I'm kind of like perceiving?

230
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,180
Because at the end of the day, we choose to ignore volition even though we know it's there

231
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,020
and that it actually wants something better for us.

232
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,380
I genuinely think that making a change is not always about working harder at something.

233
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,620
In fact, a lot of times I think it's about making the process easier, simpler, streamlined

234
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,820
with the least amount of friction.

235
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,180
And you may find that over time, just like any other habit, the more you train yourself

236
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,060
to detect and resolve the sources of friction in your life, you actually find it a little

237
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,700
easier to listen to volition when it talks to you.

238
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,660
So that is why we ignore volition in real life.

239
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,380
I am very curious to hear what all of you think about this.

240
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,460
And if there's anything that you can think of that is a source of friction in your life

241
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,140
that you may not even really known is there.

242
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,700
So far, Disco Elysium has been amazing at like bringing together real mental health

243
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,820
with practical game mechanics.

244
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,860
And I find that really fun to talk about.

245
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,980
So I'm also curious if there's other games and other systems in them that you think would

246
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,620
be worthy of this kind of analysis as well.

247
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Who knows?

248
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,260
Maybe this could be like a series or something where we talk about like the crossover between

249
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,100
game design and mental health and how mechanics can represent real cognitive structures that

250
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,860
we use and deal with every day.

251
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,460
So thank you for watching my video.

252
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,980
I hope you enjoyed it.

253
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,780
Let me know if you'd like to hear more of this kind of discussion with other game mechanics

254
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,060
and if you want to see more of where these ideas are kind of taking shape in the discussions

255
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,460
we're having about them.

256
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,980
We're currently uploading a full let's play of Disco Elysium with lots of like psychological

257
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,300
analysis intermixed in that.

258
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,140
So subscribe if you want to catch those as they release or other standalone analyses

259
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
like this one.

260
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:09,860
Right now, these two are the friction between me and finishing this video.

261
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
It's okay.

262
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
I love them.

263
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,700
So with that said, I will see you guys next time.

264
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,300
I'm going to go try to make some of my own good decisions right now.
