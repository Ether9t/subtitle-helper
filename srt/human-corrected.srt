1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:04,133
okay

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,966
let's talk about why we make bad decisions

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,700
so if you're like me then

4
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,750
you've probably been in that situation

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,691
where it's the end of the day or it's the morning

6
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:15,133
and you're thinking like okay

7
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,362
I'm gonna make a solid plan for myself 

8
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,866
today I'm gonna be disciplined

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm gonna come home from work

10
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,766
and I'm gonna get all these errands done

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,056
and I'm gonna treat myself really well

12
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:30,966
I'm gonna make a nice healthy proper meal

13
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,933
I'm gonna go to the gym afterwards I'm gonna exercise

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,550
and then maybe when I come home

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,166
 I'll like start reading a book or something

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,733
I'll do something a little different

17
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,616
something that makes me feel like

18
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm gonna advance my life in a new positive direction

19
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,363
this is our real life volition

20
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:55,133
and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life decisions

21
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,600
but this doesn't always work out that way

22
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,400
sometimes you get to the end of the day

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,136
and you realise that you haven't been very disciplined at all

24
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:08,366
a lot of those errands are still incomplete or like half started

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,424
we didn't end up going to the gym

26
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:12,866
and instead of making a proper meal

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,866
we've ordered some definitely not healthy take out food

28
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,600
and instead of reading that book

29
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:22,200
maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,466
and we've not advanced our life

31
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,616
in a positive meaningful direction in any way at all

32
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,300
what is happening here

33
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,000
why would we ignore the voice of volition

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,400
that's telling us to do all of these beneficial positive things

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,166
well it could be a lot of things honestly

36
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,875
and definitely having like a mental health diagnosis

37
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,300
is going to amplify this problem a lot more

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,700
but even for the average person

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
this happens like pretty often

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,400
I mean it certainly happens to me

41
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,533
so what I wanted to share with you today

42
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,800
is a framework for understanding why this problem happens 

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,266
and what we can actually do about it

44
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:06,133
this is a real problem that actually comes up in my work as a therapist kind of often 

45
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:11,866
and I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated so clearly 

46
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:18,066
and given such a unique role within the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has 

47
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:18,733
so okay

48
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,700
there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,866
and go through with our good intentions

50
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:29,766
and it has to do with something called *psychological friction*

51
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,466
so in this context friction is

52
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,666
any force either internal or external

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,300
which opposes a behavioral change

54
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,066
so what do we know about regular friction right

55
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,616
if I am standing on an ice rink

56
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:47,666
and I move my body weight around a little bit

57
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,066
I'm going to start sliding around on the ice

58
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,066
there's not a lot of friction

59
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,333
between me and the surface that's under me

60
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,933
when I step off the ice

61
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,700
and now I'm standing on concrete

62
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:01,066
when I shift myself around I don't move right

63
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,200
there is a lot more friction between me and the ground

64
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,333
and psychologically

65
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,766
this principle is basically the same thing

66
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,100
if you imagine you're trying to do something

67
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,000
it's going to be much harder if there is more friction

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,166
between you and the process

69
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,900
and it's going to be much easier

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,566
if there is less friction

71
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,900
when friction is introduced

72
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,800
and we'll talk about what kinds of friction

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,966
are very common

74
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,800
the process tends to slow down

75
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,300
we tend to have a harder time

76
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,400
actually completing the thing we're trying to do

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,825
and it's much more likely that we're going to give up

78
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:35,386
when there is less friction

79
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:39,208
or we find a way to reduce the friction that's there

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,842
the process can start to speed up again

81
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,886
and will find more motivation

82
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,900
to actually keepworking on it

83
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,500
and really we can kind of think of this how habits work right

84
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,100
when you're trying to do something new

85
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,893
it can be hard to stay motivated and be consistent

86
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,133
and be very disciplined in it

87
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,966
we have to be very rigorous and consistent with things

88
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,777
before they start to get easier

89
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:08,700
and we have to do less work to get ourselves in the mindset to do it 

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,066
like if we're trying to start you know an exercise regiment or something

91
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,400
so there's a lot of friction

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,325
between us and this new behavioral change

93
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,098
things start to get easier

94
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,250
when we learn more about that process

95
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,802
and we start developing sort of like the mental tricks

96
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:28,650
to get ourselves into that kind of mode

97
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,500
where we want to do it

98
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,175
we don't have to convince ourselves anymore 

99
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:37,300
and our stamina to like do the thing that's difficult starts to go up 

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,275
and

101
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,600
there is a lot less friction here

102
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,800
we start to develop that habit

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,183
when the process becomes streamlined and simplified

104
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:50,043
and we have to do less of the psychological work

105
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,766
to get ourselves moving on it

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
so basically

107
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,066
the things that we tend to do the most

108
00:04:56,066 --> 00:05:00,141
and the patterns of behavior that we tend to repeat

109
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:05,166
are those where the amount of friction between us and the process is very minimal 

110
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,366
so this is part of why

111
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,466
when we tell ourselves

112
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,600
we're going to do all these nice things

113
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,066
a lot of friction tends to get introduced in that process

114
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:17,722
because thinking about doing all those things isn't really that hard

115
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,500
but when it comes down to it

116
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,075
it takes an extra layer of scheduling and timing

117
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:26,666
and trying to like balance your energy throughout the day

118
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,066
you better make sure that you slept enough

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,566
ate well enough that your hydrated

120
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:35,716
that you actually have the motivation at the time you're trying to do that thing

121
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,749
to actually start it

122
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,997
 honestly like at the end of a long day

123
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:44,741
we're not typically still in the high motivation state

124
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,533
that we were at the beginning of the day

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,700
when volition was telling us

126
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,716
how awesome we're gonna be sometime later

127
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:56,933
we are not always interested or capable

128
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,275
sometimes of fighting against all of the friction

129
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,200
that has found us along the way

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,966
so we choose things that are less difficult right

131
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,787
the kinds of habits that we have already formed

132
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:09,325
that we know work

133
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,166
that don't require a lot of mental fortitude to carry out

134
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:18,666
volition asks us to do things which are good for us

135
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,466
but that they are difficult to accomplish

136
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:25,333
and so it's often the voices of half light or electrochemistry

137
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,350
that give us other options

138
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,766
and don't ask us to fight against a bunch of friction

139
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,400
they just want us to chase whatever

140
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,466
impulse makes sense in the moment

141
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,933
you should tell people to off more often

142
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,500
I should I should do that I

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,730
No you shouldn't you're an officer of the law

144
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,786
maybe I shouldn't

145
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:48,510
so this has been really fascinating to see portrayed in Disco Elysium 

146
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,133
because in my playthrough

147
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,410
I've been kind of role playing

148
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,333
and demonstrating this whole problem right

149
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,700
and so sometimes

150
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,745
volition will chime in with a thought

151
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:02,266
and I just ignore it and I go do something that

152
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,133
for a lot of people

153
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,466
looks like it's not really within my character's best interest

154
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,166
and they're right

155
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,991
but that's how people are

156
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,725
we are kind of walking contradictions

157
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:18,133
we just don't always act in our own best interests

158
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,976
like I said

159
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:22,766
even though the thought to do something good is available to us

160
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,325
that doesn't mean we're actually going to do it

161
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,608
in fact

162
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:29,150
we're very keenly aware a lot of the times

163
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,200
that we are doing something that's not in our best interest

164
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,366
and we're pulling the ice cream out of the fridge 

165
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,000
and telling ourselves along the way

166
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,166
I really shouldn't

167
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,500
but I'm gonna anyway

168
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,606
so this is a real problem right

169
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:45,675
and the game is so good at demonstrating this

170
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,766
so what do you do about this right

171
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:49,973
I like the word friction

172
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:54,666
because it gives us a very easy framework to understand

173
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:59,050
and so when I'm working with someone who is struggling with motivation

174
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,082
or a lot of times were sort of questioning

175
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,500
like I'm very passionate about this thing

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,900
but I don't find myself doing it a lot

177
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,900
like I don't know what's wrong with me

178
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,333
maybe I've lost interest in it

179
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,933
that's where we may start to ask the question

180
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:16,900
okay well what kind of friction is in this process for you 

181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,933
and how might we start to work to reduce it 

182
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,092
and the best place to start is actually trying to understand

183
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:26,475
whether this friction is even real or not

184
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,503
because that's the thing

185
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:33,533
there is real psychological friction and perceived psychological friction 

186
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:34,766
now

187
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:39,766
that is not to say that friction by itself is a bad thing 

188
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,089
in fact there are some cases

189
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,217
where introducing friction to some sort of behavioral process

190
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,308
 is actually a good thing

191
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,660
think about an addiction for example right

192
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,133
which is a big part of disco elysium

193
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:57,870
where the habit to seek and use a substance

194
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,338
has become very normalized for us

195
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,314
and we're always looking to have the least amount of friction

196
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:08,266
between us and continuing that substance use

197
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,600
and so actually when you're trying to

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,796
work on breaking a habit

199
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:16,766
or lower the chances that an addiction develops

200
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,400
you actually want to introduce friction to the process

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,745
essentially making things harder is going to slow down  

202
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:28,766
and may completely interrupt the process that we are trying to change 

203
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,300
this is why when people are trying to quit a substance 

204
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,120
they typically go to a detox center

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,733
and then they go into full rehabilitation

206
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,801
and that's to like completely separate themselves from 

207
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,246
the environment and all of the social and psychological issues 

208
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:48,133
which made repeating that pattern of behavior very easy 

209
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:53,335
we want to introduce a ton of friction to this person's life temporarily 

210
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:56,255
so that we can learn to develop better strategies

211
00:09:56,255 --> 00:10:01,166
to cope with the issues that resulted in some sort of addiction

212
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,300
so this was all like pretty well demonstrated in my own play through 

213
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,700
in which we spent ... a lot of time

214
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,900
trying to find a way to buy a pack of cigarettes

215
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,533
and I was explaining how

216
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,202
when we have a chemical dependence on something

217
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:22,100
like we are often going to prioritize that over most other things right 

218
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,849
higher order things like solving a crime

219
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,466
or strengthening our relationships

220
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,533
and so the thought pattern may have been something like

221
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:31,333
okay well

222
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,166
our character wants to smoke

223
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,533
how do I do that

224
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,100
what's the simplest path here

225
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,866
I want to find the way with the least amount of friction

226
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,366
like I need this *now*

227
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,000
so we go into Frittte and Frittte girl is there okay

228
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
and she tells us that

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,500
we don't have the money for cigarettes

230
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,133
there's a way that we can get the money for cigarettes

231
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,766
what we can do is we can collect tare and tare is trash

232
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,166
and so what we can do is try to find a bag

233
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,600
so that we can pick up all the tear in Revachol

234
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,000
and we'll spend as much time as we need to collecting this 

235
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,266
so that we can go and buy the cigarettes

236
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:08,075
and that sounds like kind of a difficult drawn out process

237
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,366
and it was

238
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:13,333
however there was less friction in doing that

239
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,166
than there would be if I tried to solve this murder

240
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,266
without the stimulant that my body is craving

241
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,850
I may have been telling myself like

242
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,333
 look this whole detective thing is just way too hard without a buzz right

243
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,366
there's too much friction

244
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,300
I can't talk to people I can't think straight right

245
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,175
I'm gonna do this other thing that's still difficult

246
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,072
but maybe it will help like reduce 

247
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:40,575
the amount of friction in this other bigger more difficult task 

248
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,600
and then we'll go do it

249
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,800
and that is an example of totally made up perceived fake friction right

250
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,800
like smoking cigarettes doesn't actually make us a better detective

251
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,800
like it gives us a maybe a false sense of plus 1 to our intellect 

252
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,925
but we may have convinced ourselves

253
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:03,900
as you know

254
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,166
many people who are struggling with substances do

255
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:11,700
that we are inadequate or unable to perform a certain task without this thing 

256
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,900
and so

257
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,733
like we look at that and say no there's too much friction 

258
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't do that it's too hard

259
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,533
having this substance will make it easier

260
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:26,466
when really what we have done is just choose something that's equally hard 

261
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,375
and we're reinforcing a bad pattern of behavior

262
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,733
and one that's pretty bad for us

263
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,800
so that was a demonstration of the perceived kind of friction right 

264
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,733
and then this happened again

265
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,966
nearing the end of our first day in Revachol

266
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,866
in which my character had

267
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,733
also been searching for ways to drink alcohol

268
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,966
and so we come to the end of the day

269
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,125
and we hadn't really found any opportunities to do that

270
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:56,533
besides like licking some alcohol off of a table

271
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,966
but so we're standing there at the end of the day

272
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,333
and we're talking to Garte

273
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,466
who is the manager of the whirling in rags

274
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,700
and we're asking him

275
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,866
like can I buy a drink

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,766
look I've had a long day okay

277
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:12,066
I spent most of it looking for cigarettes

278
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,666
and then I did a little bit of detective work

279
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,700
and it has tired me out okay

280
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,575
now I need the other substance that I'm depended on

281
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,000
to sleep all of this off

282
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:26,133
and that's when Gart tells us like dude I'm not the bartender okay

283
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,166
I don't actually serve drinks here

284
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,075
find another way to get drunk

285
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,000
you know what

286
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,550
the impact of rejection is stronger than than

287
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:38,266
the impulse to drink from my guy right now

288
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:39,400
as a sorry cop

289
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,630
I abandon I'm going to abandon the desire to drink

290
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,900
because I am too ashamed to ask further

291
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,266
he effectively made it

292
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:51,175
more difficult for us to do this 

293
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:51,719
and

294
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,100
in my mind and in simulating the characters perspective

295
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,125
like we decided that this was just too much work right

296
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,966
like we're already tired enough

297
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:05,300
who knows how much more time and effort and money this was gonna take

298
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,766
to get some alcohol right

299
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,566
and so we gave up

300
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,600
there was too much friction introduced to the process

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,533
 it would involve talking to people

302
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,966
it would have involved budgeting

303
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:20,500
it would have involved embarrassing ourselves even more

304
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,366
and so with a lot of friction introduced to the process

305
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:30,500
this slowed down and has the potential to completely interrupt the problem behavior 

306
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,275
so I just find this whole thing fascinating

307
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:38,700
that the voice of volition represents

308
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,550
what is in real life

309
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,012
our good intentions to make healthy balance decisions for ourselves

310
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,366
and yet

311
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:48,766
typically

312
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,380
the things that it wants us to do require a lot of effort

313
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,388
a lot of deep behavioral changes

314
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:59,168
and there are often a lot of barriers in between us and doing them

315
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,133
and here you have like other voices

316
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:05,533
which have not so great intentions for us

317
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,133
in competition with volition

318
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:10,466
and there's way less friction involved in those

319
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,566
and so we chase those impulses

320
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,566
even though we know we shouldn't

321
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:17,366
that is just real life

322
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,800
and I love disco elysium for this

323
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,900
it's been one of my favorite parts of the game so far

324
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:23,866
so

325
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,066
what can you take away from this well

326
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,822
consider a change that you've been trying to make recently

327
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:32,575
or a habit that you're trying to break 

328
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,766
and ask yourself

329
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,958
what is the friction involved in this process right

330
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:42,425
what is making it hard for me to make this good change 

331
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,400
and is that a real source of friction

332
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,266
or is it one that I'm kind of like perceiving

333
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,700
because at the end of the day

334
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,238
we choose to ignore volition even though we know it's there 

335
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:56,041
and that it actually wants something better for us

336
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,733
I genuinely think that

337
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:03,300
making a change is not always about working harder at something 

338
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,700
in fact a lot of times

339
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,533
I think it's about making the process easier right

340
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,300
simpler streamlined

341
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,200
with the least amount of friction

342
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,466
and you may find that over time

343
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,066
just like any other habit

344
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,866
the more you train yourself to

345
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:23,733
detect and resolve the sources of friction in your life

346
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:27,750
you actually find it a little easier to listen to volition

347
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,800
when it talks to you

348
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,125
so

349
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:34,500
that is why we ignore volition in real life

350
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:39,859
I am very curious to hear what all of you think about this 

351
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,000
and if there's anything that you can think of

352
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,600
that is a source of friction in your life

353
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,883
that you may not even even really known is there

354
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,525
so far Disco Elysium has been amazing

355
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:56,400
at like bringing together real mental health with practical game mechanics 

356
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,866
and I find that really fun to talk about

357
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:04,333
so I'm also curious if there are other games and other systems in them 

358
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:07,666
that you think would be worthy of this kind of analysis as well 

359
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:08,533
who knows

360
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,663
maybe this could be like a series or something

361
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:15,527
where we talk about like the crossover between game design and mental health

362
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:19,868
and how mechanics can represent real cognitive structures

363
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,620
that we use and deal with every day

364
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,533
so thank you for watching my video

365
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:25,666
I hope you enjoyed it

366
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,450
yeah let me know if you'd like to hear more 

367
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,800
of this kind of discussion with other game mechanics 

368
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,400
and if you want to see more of where these ideas are kind of taking shape 

369
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,316
and the discussions we're having about them

370
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:40,971
we're currently uploading a full let's play of Disco Elysium

371
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:44,066
with lots of psychological analysis 

372
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,133
intermixed in that

373
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,897
so subscribe

374
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:52,366
if you want to catch those as the release or other standalone analyses like this one 

375
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:54,697
猫猫打闹

376
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,900
right now these two are the friction between me and finishing this video 

377
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,066
it's okay I love them

378
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,700
so with that said I will see you guys next time

379
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,566
I'm gonna go try to make some of my own good decisions right now
