1
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:06,534
Okay, let's talk about why we make bad decisions.

2
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:17,764
So if you're like me, then you've probably been in that situation where it's the end of the day or it's the morning and you're thinking like, okay, I'm gonna make a solid plan for myself.

3
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,426
Today, I'm gonna be disciplined.

4
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:27,149
I'm going to come home from work, and I'm going to get all these errands done, and I'm going to treat myself really well.

5
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:30,630
I'm going to make a nice, healthy, proper meal.

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,411
I'm going to go to the gym afterwards.

7
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:33,572
I'm going to exercise.

8
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:38,074
And then maybe when I come home, I'll start reading a book or something.

9
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:46,038
I'll do something a little different, something that makes me feel like I'm going to advance my life in a new, positive direction.

10
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:54,599
This is our real life volition, and it's there to lead you on your way to making good life decisions.

11
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,341
But this doesn't always work out that way.

12
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:01,925
Sometimes you get to the end of the day and you realize that you haven't been very disciplined.

13
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:02,815
at all.

14
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:07,979
A lot of those errands are still incomplete or like half started.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,585
We didn't end up going to the gym and instead of making a proper meal, we've ordered some definitely not healthy takeout food.

16
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:28,153
And instead of reading that book, maybe you end up watching a show you've already seen and we've not advanced our life in a positive, meaningful direction in any way at all.

17
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:29,935
What is happening here?

18
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:38,122
Why would we ignore the voice of volition that's telling us to do all of these beneficial, positive things?

19
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:40,824
Well, it could be a lot of things, honestly.

20
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:47,050
And definitely having like a mental health diagnosis is going to amplify this problem a lot more.

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,433
But even for the average person, this happens like pretty often.

22
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,055
I mean, it certainly happens to me.

23
00:01:52,915 --> 00:02:00,902
So what I wanted to share with you today is a framework for understanding why this problem happens and what we can actually do about it.

24
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:17,354
This is a real problem that actually comes up in my work as a therapist kind of often, and I have really enjoyed seeing it demonstrated so clearly and given such a unique role within the structure of a game like Disco Elysium has.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,543
So okay, there is a reason that we do not always follow the voice of volition and go through with our good intentions.

26
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:29,525
And it has to do with something called psychological friction.

27
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:38,009
So in this context, friction is any force, either internal or external, which opposes a behavioral change.

28
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,770
So what do we know about like regular friction, right?

29
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,992
If I am standing on an ice rink and I

30
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:49,614
move my body weight around a little bit, I'm going to start sliding around on the ice.

31
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,976
There's not a lot of friction between me and the surface that's under me.

32
00:02:54,597 --> 00:03:01,080
When I step off the ice and now I'm standing on concrete, when I shift myself around, I don't move, right?

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,962
There is a lot more friction between me and the ground.

34
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:07,464
And psychologically, this principle is basically the same thing.

35
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,845
If you imagine you're trying to do something,

36
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:19,248
It's going to be much harder if there is more friction between you and the process, and it's going to be much easier if there is less friction.

37
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:27,570
When friction is introduced, and we'll talk about what kinds of friction are very common, the process tends to slow down.

38
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,712
We tend to have a harder time actually completing the thing we're trying to do, and it's much more likely that we're going to give up.

39
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:38,554
When there is less friction or we find a way to reduce the friction that's there,

40
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:45,559
the process can start to speed up again and we'll find more motivation to actually keep working on it.

41
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,941
And really, we can kind of think of this how like habits work, right?

42
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:57,808
When you're trying to do something new, it can be hard to stay motivated and be consistent and be very disciplined in it.

43
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:05,754
We have to be very rigorous and consistent with things before they start to get easier and we have to do less work to

44
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,557
get ourselves in the mindset to do it.

45
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:11,802
Like if we're trying to start, you know, an exercise regimen or something.

46
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:15,508
So there's a lot of friction between us and this new behavioral change.

47
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:37,697
things start to get easier when we learn more about that process and we start developing sort of like the mental tricks to get ourselves into that kind of mode where we want to do it we don't have to convince ourselves anymore and our stamina to like do the thing that's difficult starts to go up and

48
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,272
there's a lot less friction here.

49
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:52,417
We start to develop that habit when the process becomes streamlined and simplified and we have to do less of the psychological work to get ourselves moving on it.

50
00:04:52,957 --> 00:05:04,803
So basically the things that we tend to do the most and the patterns of behavior that we tend to repeat are those where the amount of friction between us and the process is very minimal.

51
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:09,288
So this is part of why when we tell ourselves we're going to do all of these nice things,

52
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:36,337
a lot of friction tends to get introduced in that process because thinking about doing all of those things isn't really that hard but when it comes down to it it takes an extra layer of scheduling and timing and trying to like balance your energy throughout the day you better make sure that you slept enough ate well enough that you're hydrated that you actually have the motivation at the time you're trying to do that thing to actually

53
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:51,493
start it honestly like at the end of a long day we're not typically still in the high motivation state that we were at the beginning of the day when volition was telling us how awesome we're going to be sometime later

54
00:05:52,054 --> 00:06:01,898
We are not always interested or capable sometimes of fighting against all of the friction that has found us along the way.

55
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:05,659
So we choose things that are less difficult, right?

56
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,783
The kinds of habits that we've already formed, that we know work, that don't require a lot of mental fortitude to carry out.

57
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:21,054
Volition asks us to do things which are good for us, but that they are difficult to accomplish.

58
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:32,399
And so it's often the voices of half-light or electrochemistry that give us other options and don't ask us to fight against a bunch of friction.

59
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,160
They just want us to chase whatever impulse makes sense in the moment.

60
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,302
You should tell people to f*** off more often.

61
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:40,382
I should.

62
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:41,162
I should do that.

63
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:41,803
No, you shouldn't.

64
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:43,764
You're an officer of the law.

65
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:44,664
Maybe I shouldn't.

66
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:55,254
So this has been really fascinating to see portrayed in Disco Elysium because in my playthrough I've been kind of role-playing and demonstrating this whole problem, right?

67
00:06:55,374 --> 00:07:01,919
And so sometimes volition will chime in with a thought and I just ignore it and I go do something that

68
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:07,336
for a lot of people, looks like it's not really within my character's best interest.

69
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:08,936
And they're right.

70
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,557
But that's how people are.

71
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,978
We are kind of walking contradictions.

72
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,580
We just don't always act in our own best interests.

73
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:25,133
Like I said, even though the thought to do something good is available to us, that doesn't mean we're actually going to do it.

74
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:39,098
In fact, we're very keenly aware a lot of the times that we are doing something that's not in our best interest, and we're pulling the ice cream out of the fridge and telling ourselves along the way, I really shouldn't, but I'm gonna anyway.

75
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,754
So this is a real problem, right?

76
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:45,355
And the game is so good at demonstrating this.

77
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,576
So what do you do about this, right?

78
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:54,377
I like the word friction because it gives us a very easy framework to understand.

79
00:07:54,677 --> 00:08:06,479
And so when I'm working with someone who is struggling with like motivation or a lot of times we're sort of questioning like, I'm very passionate about this thing, but I don't find myself doing it a lot.

80
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,739
Like, I don't know what's wrong with me.

81
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,079
Maybe I've lost interest in it.

82
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:19,664
That's where we may start to ask the question, okay, well, what kind of friction is in this process for you, and how might we start to work to reduce it?

83
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:27,888
And the best place to start is actually trying to understand whether this friction is even real or not, because that's the thing.

84
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,250
There is real psychological friction and perceived psychological friction.

85
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,071
Now,

86
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,443
That is not to say that friction by itself is a bad thing.

87
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:47,590
In fact, there are some cases where introducing friction to some sort of behavioral process is actually a good thing.

88
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,693
Think about an addiction, for example, right, which is a big part of Disco Elysium.

89
00:08:52,453 --> 00:09:07,927
where the habit to seek and use a substance has become very normalized for us and we're always looking to have the least amount of friction between us and continuing that substance use.

90
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,169
And so actually when you're trying to

91
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:20,253
work on breaking a habit or lower the chances that an addiction develops, you actually want to introduce friction to the process.

92
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:28,477
Essentially making things harder is going to slow down and may completely interrupt the process that we are trying to change.

93
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:37,405
This is why when people are trying to quit a substance, they typically go to a detox center and then they go into full rehabilitation.

94
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:47,875
And that's to like completely separate themselves from the environment and all of the social and psychological issues which made repeating that pattern of behavior very easy.

95
00:09:48,115 --> 00:10:00,865
We want to introduce a ton of friction to this person's life temporarily so that we can learn to develop better strategies to cope with the issues that resulted in some sort of addiction.

96
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:06,890
So this was all like pretty well demonstrated in my own playthrough in which we spent

97
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:32,704
a lot of time trying to find a way to buy a pack of cigarettes and I was explaining how when we have a chemical dependence on something like we are often going to prioritize that over most other things right higher order things like solving a crime or strengthening our relationships and so the thought pattern may have been something like okay well our character wants to smoke

98
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:34,326
How do I do that?

99
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:35,987
What's the simplest path here?

100
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:40,149
I want to find the way with the least amount of friction, like I need this now.

101
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,811
So we go into Fritte, and Fritte girl is there, okay?

102
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,953
And she tells us that we don't have the money for cigarettes.

103
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,715
There's a way that we can get the money for cigarettes.

104
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:53,377
What we can do is we can collect tear, and tear is trash.

105
00:10:53,817 --> 00:11:03,910
And so what we can do is try to find a bag so that we can pick up all the tear in Revachol and we'll spend as much time as we need to collecting this so that we can go and buy the cigarettes.

106
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:07,896
And that sounds like kind of a difficult, drawn out process.

107
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:08,977
And it was.

108
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:19,844
However, there was less friction in doing that than there would be if I tried to solve this murder without the stimulant that my body is craving.

109
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:26,929
I may have been telling myself, like, look, this whole detective thing is just way too hard without a buzz, right?

110
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,329
There's too much friction.

111
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,430
I can't talk to people.

112
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,011
I can't think straight, right?

113
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:38,817
I'm going to do this other thing that's still difficult, but maybe it will help, like, reduce the amount of friction in this other bigger...

114
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,427
more difficult task, and then we'll go do it.

115
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:49,166
And that is an example of totally made-up perceived fake friction, right?

116
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,829
Smoking cigarettes doesn't actually make us a better detective.

117
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,494
It gives us maybe a false sense of plus one to our intellect.

118
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:11,323
But we may have convinced ourselves, as many people who are struggling with substances do, that we are inadequate or unable to perform a certain task without this thing,

119
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:31,335
and so like we look at that and say no there's too much friction i can't do that it's too hard having this substance will make it easier when really what we have done is just choose something that's equally hard and we're reinforcing a bad pattern of behavior and one that's pretty bad for us

120
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,323
So that was a demonstration of the perceived kind of friction, right?

121
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:46,409
Then this happened again, nearing the end of our first day in Revachol, in which my character had also been searching for ways to drink alcohol.

122
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,832
And so we come to the end of the day and we hadn't really found any opportunities to do that besides, like,

123
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:56,194
licking some alcohol off of a table.

124
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:06,438
But so we're standing there at the end of the day and we're talking to Gart, who is the manager of the Whirling and Rags, and we're asking him, like, can I buy a drink?

125
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,419
Look, I've had a long day, okay?

126
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:15,361
I spent most of it looking for cigarettes and then I did a little bit of detective work and it has tired me out, okay?

127
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,443
Now I need the other substance that I'm dependent on to

128
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:21,664
Sleep all of this off.

129
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:25,889
And that's when Gart tells us, like, dude, I'm not the bartender, okay?

130
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,891
I don't actually serve drinks here.

131
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:29,934
Find another way to get drunk.

132
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:30,795
You know what?

133
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:39,004
The impact of rejection is stronger than the impulse to drink from my guy right now as a sorry cop.

134
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:47,747
I abandon... I'm going to abandon the desire to drink because I am too ashamed to ask further.

135
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:51,433
He effectively made it more difficult for us to do this and...

136
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:58,767
in my mind and in simulating the character's perspective, like we decided that this was just too much work, right?

137
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,648
Like we're already tired enough.

138
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:08,614
Who knows how much more time and effort and money this was going to take to get some alcohol, right?

139
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:10,195
And so we gave up.

140
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:20,184
There was too much friction introduced to the process that it would involve talking to people, it would have involved budgeting, it would have involved embarrassing ourselves even more.

141
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:30,133
And so with a lot of friction introduced to the process, this slowed down and has the potential to completely interrupt the problem behavior.

142
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:38,120
So I just find this whole thing fascinating that the voice of volition represents

143
00:14:39,261 --> 00:15:01,377
what is in real life just our good intentions to make healthy balanced decisions for ourselves and yet typically the things that it wants us to do require a lot of effort a lot of deep behavioral changes and there are often a lot of barriers in between us and doing them and here you have like other voices which

144
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:23,150
have not so great intentions for us in competition with volition and there's way less friction involved in those and so we chase those impulses even though we know we shouldn't that is just real life and i love disco elysium for this it's been one of my favorite parts of the game so far so

145
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:25,227
What can you take away from this?

146
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:36,674
Well, consider a change that you've been trying to make recently or a habit that you're trying to break and ask yourself, like, what is the friction involved in this process, right?

147
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:41,997
Like, what is making it hard for me to make this good change?

148
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:46,860
And is that a real source of friction or is it one that I'm kind of like perceiving?

149
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,341
Because at the end of the day,

150
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:57,346
we choose to ignore volition even though we know it's there and that it actually wants something better for us i genuinely think that

151
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:03,028
Making a change is not always about working harder at something.

152
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:11,910
In fact, a lot of times, I think it's about making the process easier, simpler, streamlined, with the least amount of friction.

153
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:23,353
And you may find that over time, just like any other habit, the more you train yourself to detect and resolve the sources of friction in your life,

154
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:28,535
you actually find it a little easier to listen to volition when it talks to you.

155
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:34,078
So that is why we ignore volition in real life.

156
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:47,723
I am very curious to hear what all of you think about this, and if there's anything that you can think of that is a source of friction in your life that you may not have even really known is there.

157
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:55,892
So far, Disco Elysium has been amazing at bringing together real mental health with practical game mechanics.

158
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,614
And I find that really fun to talk about.

159
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:07,399
So I'm also curious if there's other games and other systems in them that you think would be worthy of this kind of analysis as well.

160
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,260
Who knows?

161
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:22,289
Maybe this could be like a series or something where we talk about like the crossover between game design and mental health and how mechanics can represent real cognitive structures that we use and deal with every day.

162
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,302
So thank you for watching my video.

163
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,283
I hope you enjoyed it.

164
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:30,364
Yeah, let me know if you'd like to hear more of this kind of discussion with other game mechanics.

165
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:35,865
And if you want to see more of where these ideas are kind of taking shape and the discussions we're having about them.

166
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:45,807
We're currently uploading a full Let's Play of Disco Elysium with lots of psychological analysis intermixed in that.

167
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:52,048
So subscribe if you want to catch those as they release or other standalone analyses like this one.

168
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:04,368
Right now, these two are the friction between me and finishing this video.

169
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:10,715
It's okay, I love them.

170
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,378
So with that said, I will see you guys next time.

171
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:18,142
I'm gonna go try to make some of my own good decisions right now.
